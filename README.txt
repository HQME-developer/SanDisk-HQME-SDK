HQME SDK Release Notes
====


The HQME SDK is based, in part, on the [IEEE P2200/D2](http://standards.ieee.org/develop/project/2200.html) draft standard, and implements queue management and delayed download functionality for the Android platform. For an overview of HQME, see http://www.hqme.org. 

For details and a walkthrough on how to use this SDK, see the document <i>HQME SDK Quick Start Guide</i> in the docs directory of this repository.

In some cases, additional APIs were added to support functionality not explicitly mandated in the standard draft.
